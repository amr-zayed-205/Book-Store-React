        React Book Store is a beginner-level web project developed using
        React.js. The goal of this project is to create a simple and clean
        online bookstore where users can easily browse and view books. The
        website is designed to be fast, responsive, and user-friendly, making it
        easy for visitors to explore different book categories, see book
        details, and prepare for future features like adding to cart or user
        login.

        This project focuses on learning and applying React concepts such as
        components, routing, props, and state management. It serves as a
        foundation for building a more advanced e-commerce site in the future,
        with possibilities to add features like search, filters, and backend
        integration.
      </p>

        Whether you're testing it as a developer or just exploring books, React
        Book Store shows how modern web tools can be used to build real-world
        applications step by step.
